# Class Notes [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AntoineGagne/class-notes.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AntoineGagne/class-notes)

A collection of my class notes taken in Markdown.

## Dependencies

- Make
- Pandoc
- LaTeX compiler (if you want the PDFs)
- Python 3 (if you want to use the script to sort the appendix)

## How to build

To build, you must first go into the directory for which you want the notes and you then run the command `make`.
If you want to remove the notes, you just run the command `make clean`.
