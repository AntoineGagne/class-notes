# Class Notes

A collection of my class notes taken in Markdown.

## Dependencies

- Make
- Pandoc
- LaTeX compiler (if you want the PDFs)

## How to build

To build, you must first go into the directory for which you want the notes and you then run the command `make`.
If you want to remove the notes, you just run the command `make clean`.
